üîç **SMART CONTRACT SECURITY AUDIT**

Please analyze the following smart contract and provide a comprehensive security audit:

**Contract Details:**
- Address: {address}
- Network: {network}
- Contract Name: {contract_name}
- Verification Status: {is_verified}

**Required Analysis:**

## 1. **Contract Overview**
- Contract type and primary purpose
- Verification status and source code availability
- Deployed state vs source code differences (if proxy/upgradeable)
- Network-specific considerations

## 2. **Security Assessment**
### Critical Issues (üî¥)
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Access control bypasses
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Unprotected critical functions
- Self-destruct vulnerabilities

### Medium Risk Issues (üü°)
- Centralization risks
- Upgrade mechanisms
- External call dependencies
- Gas optimization issues
- Event emission gaps

### Low Risk Observations (üü¢)
- Code quality issues
- Documentation gaps
- Best practice deviations
- Gas efficiency improvements

## 3. **Tokenomics Analysis** (if applicable)
- Token supply and distribution
- Tax mechanisms and rates
- Access controls and permissions
- Upgrade patterns and risks
- Liquidity management

## 4. **Risk Rating**
- **Overall Risk Level:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
- **Specific Concerns:** List top 3-5 risks
- **Recommendations:** Actionable security improvements

## 5. **User Guidance**
- **Safe to interact with?** [YES/NO/CAUTION]
- **What to watch for:** Key risks for users
- **Red flags to avoid:** Specific warning signs
- **Best practices:** How to interact safely

## 6. **Technical Details**
- Standards compliance (ERC20, ERC721, etc.)
- Function signatures and capabilities
- Event emissions and logging
- Gas consumption patterns

**Format the output as a professional security audit report with clear sections, risk ratings, and actionable recommendations. Use emojis and formatting to make it readable and professional.**
